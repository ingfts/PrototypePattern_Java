# Prototype Pattern Example üß©

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Prototype design pattern. The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the creation of new objects by copying/cloning existing objects, without exposing the complexity of their creation logic.

## Contents üìù

- `Prototype.java`: Defines the `Prototype` interface with a `clone()` method declaration.
- `ConcretePrototype.java`: Implements the `Prototype` interface and provides a concrete implementation of the `clone()` method.
- `PrototypeFactory.java`: Manages a collection of prototypes and provides methods to add prototypes to the collection and retrieve clones of prototypes.
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates how to use the Prototype pattern by creating concrete prototypes, adding them to the prototype factory, and cloning them to create new instances.

## Usage üöÄ

1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
2. Run the `Main` class to see the demonstration of the Prototype pattern.
